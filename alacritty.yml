  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)

  #
  # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
  # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
  # following command:
  #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`

  # This is a global setting and will require a log out or restart to take
